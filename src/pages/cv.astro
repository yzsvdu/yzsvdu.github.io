    I’m a Los Angeles–based software engineer and founder building <b>Ascendit</b>, a production iOS app that uses computer
    vision to turn climbing wall photos into logged routes and community activity. I own the full stack end-to-end — SwiftUI
    mobile UI/UX, distributed backend services, and GPU-backed ML inference — and iterate directly with climbers to ship
    features that work in real gyms. I’m looking for software engineering roles where I can ship reliable systems, scale
    product experiences, and grow quickly on a strong team.

      <ul class="list-disc mx-6 grid gap-2">
        <li>
          Built and operate a production iOS app that enables universal indoor climbing route tracking by converting
          user-submitted wall photos into logged routes using computer vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed an end-to-end pipeline spanning SwiftUI capture/upload, backend orchestration, and ML inference, persisting
          results to a global database for route discovery and user progress tracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Architected a distributed backend using Django and PostgreSQL with containerized services and async processing to
          support real-world usage and growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented GPU-backed inference via a FastAPI microservice (Detectron2-based hold detection), including operational
          debugging and reliability improvements for variable network conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Validated the product in real gyms through in-person onboarding; currently supports data across <b>4 gyms</b> with
          <b>10 active users</b> generating <b>~50 weekly scans</b>.

        <li>
          Developed backend services and tooling (APIs, import scripts, migrations, and operational utilities) to support
          real-world workflows and deployments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created automation and desktop tooling in Java/Python to streamline repetitive tasks and improve iteration speed.
