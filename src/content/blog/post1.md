Indoor climbing gyms are full of creativity, movement, and constantly changing routes — but most of that experience disappears the moment you walk out the door. Problems get stripped, route cards change, and unless you took photos or wrote something down, your projects and progress are gone.

That always felt wrong to me.

Climbing is inherently social. We share beta, celebrate sends, and remember the climbs that challenged us. But the tools we use to track our climbing are still stuck in static logs and manual entries. You can record that you climbed a V4, but not which V4, what it looked like, or how the community interacted with it.

Ascendit started with a simple idea: what if every climbing wall could become interactive?

Instead of searching through lists or typing route names, Ascendit uses a camera-first experience. You scan the wall, confirm the route, and instantly create or join a shared project that anyone in the gym can contribute to. Your own scans become personalized thumbnails, building a visual timeline of your climbing instead of just numbers on a chart.

But tracking was only the beginning.

Each project becomes a living page where climbers can verify climbs, leave tips, and help each other progress. First scans are recognized, completions are shared, and the wall slowly turns into a community-powered archive of what’s happening in the gym right now — not what was there months ago.

This approach keeps the focus where it belongs: on the climbing and the people around you.

I wanted Ascendit to respect climbing culture, not gamify it in a way that feels artificial or competitive in the wrong ways. The goal isn’t to chase points, but to encourage participation, contribution, and shared discovery. When people scan, verify, and leave tips, everyone benefits from better information and stronger connections.

For me, Ascendit began as a personal project — a way to remember climbs, revisit old projects, and stay motivated between sessions. But once other climbers started using it, it became clear that this could be something bigger: a way for gyms to build shared climbing history, and for climbers to feel more connected to the spaces they train in.

And this is just the beginning.

There’s so much potential in turning physical spaces into digital communities — from better progress tracking, to richer route collaboration, to new ways of supporting gyms and setters. Ascendit will keep evolving alongside the climbers who use it, shaped by real feedback from real sessions on real walls.

Because every climb tells a story.
Ascendit just makes sure it doesn’t disappear when the holds come down.
